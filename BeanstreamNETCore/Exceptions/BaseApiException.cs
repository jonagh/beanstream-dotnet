/// <summary>
/// The base exception for all exceptions that can happen. 
/// It holds the Http status code, the category, and the unique error code.
/// 
/// The Http status code is what determines which specific exception is thrown.
/// 
/// The 'code' is a unique error ID, an int.
/// 
/// The 'category' is one of 4 numeric values:
///   1	- The transaction was successfully processed
///       These can be successes or failures. They indicate that the message went to the bank and it returned a response. 
///       The response could be a "payment approved" or even a "declined" response, along with many others.
///       These errors can be sent to the card holder and merchant to indicate a problem with their card.
///   2	- Business rule violation
///       This is usually a problem with how your account is configured. Sometimes it could be duplicate order number errors or something
///       similar. These errors need to be worked out by the developer before the software moves to production.
///   3	- Input data problem
///       The requests are inproperly formatted or the data is wrong. Invalid card number errors (code 52) can also appear here.
///       Most of these errors need to be worked out by the developer before the software moves to production.
///   4	- Transaction failed due to technical problem
///       There was a problem on the Beanstream or bank servers that is out of your control. These will respond with an http status code
///       in the 500+ range. Card holders should wait a minute and try the transaction again.
